# MavTutor
MavTutor is a system that helps tutors and students schedule sessions that foster learning and academic growth. Tutors can list the course with which they can help, while students list courses of interest to them. Sessions then group a tutor with one or more students into a scheduled time of practice, learning, and improvement.
